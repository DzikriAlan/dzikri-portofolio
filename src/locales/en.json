        "paragraph1": "A brief story: at the end of my vocational school years, I was confused about my next journey. I decided to take a leap and meet someone I had never met or known personally, only recognized from Instagram—a CEO of a software agency just starting out, and we met at his coffee shop.",
        "paragraph2": "We started by talking about backgrounds and sharing about this line of work. After many conversations, the result of that meeting was my first project: developing an exam application for LSP (Professional Certification Institute). The rest is my career journey up to now.",

    "second": {
      "question": "How to get a job as a programmer without an IT degree?",
      "answer": {
        "paragraph1": "There is no single best way, as it depends on each company. But what is certain is having a good portfolio. You don't need many—just 1-3, provided each application is properly built from frontend to backend. For example, the frontend should have an attractive UI, responsive design, and dark/light mode. The backend should implement authentication/authorization, RBAC (role-based access control), and so on. One more thing you can implement is design architecture, there are many, but the most common is MVC, and for frontend, it's recommended to try feature-based architecture."

    },
    "third": {
      "question": "What kind of team do you prefer?",
      "answer": {
        "paragraph1": "I don't expect the most skilled members in every role, I just need and like teams that document their work or projects well and clearly. For example, backend developers who document APIs, frontend developers who apply clear design architecture, product designers who document component references, and QAs who document tasks well, such as having reproduce steps, expected results, and actual results."
